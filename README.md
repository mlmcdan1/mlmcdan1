## 👋 About Me

I am a software developer focused on building useful apps and websites, learning through real projects, and improving every day. I care about clean UI, accessibility, and building things that actually get used.

## ✅ What matters to me

* Shipping projects that solve real problems  
* Clean UI that feels good to use  
* Accessibility that works for everyone  
* Consistency and progress over perfection  

## 🤖 How I use AI in my workflow

I use **Base44** to move faster while still understanding everything I build.

### What I use Base44 for

* Improving landing pages and UI sections  
* Turning rough ideas into clear layouts and components  
* Writing website copy that sounds natural  
* Building small automations for repeated updates  
* Debugging and understanding code step by step  

## 🔨 What I am working on

### 🌐 Web

* **SmartFlix**  
Movie discovery app with a modern cinematic UI and AI helper  

* **Client websites**  
Fast builds for small businesses using strong templates and clean UI  

* **Portfolio**  
Continuously improving my personal site and project presentation  

### ♿ Accessibility

* **Volunteer Developer**  
Improving heading structure, keyboard navigation, and screen reader flow  

## 🧰 Tech I use

**Languages**  
JavaScript • Python • C#  

**Frameworks and tools**  
React • Next.js • Tailwind CSS • Firebase • Node.js • MongoDB • Figma • GitHub  

## ✨ UI Style

* Smooth hover and press feedback  
* Clean section transitions on scroll  
* Card effects for featured content  
* Simple motion for icons and UI  

I like interfaces that feel responsive and easy to understand. The user should always know what to do next.
