## 👋 About Me

I am a software developer who focuses on building useful apps and sites, learning in public, and improving through real work.

### What matters to me
* Shipping projects that solve real problems
* Clean UI that feels good to use
* Accessibility that works for everyone
* Consistency and progress over perfection

## 🤖 How I use AI in my workflow

I use **Base44** to bring AI into my day to day workflow so I can move faster while I learn.

### What I use Base44 for
* Generating and improving landing pages and UI sections
* Turning rough ideas into clear page layouts and components
* Creating and iterating on website copy that sounds human
* Building quick automations for common website tasks and updates
* Helping me debug and understand code changes step by step

If you are also learning, my approach is simple: use AI to remove friction, but still make sure I understand what I ship.

Kid friendly learning app built with SwiftUI and Firebase
